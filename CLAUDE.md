# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## 📖 Context Management Strategy

**IMPORTANT**: To avoid context pollution, use lazy loading:

1. **Read this file first** (251 lines - index only)
2. **Load guides/** only when triggered (core principles, ~80-100 lines each)
3. **Reference commands/** only if details needed (full docs, ~400-500 lines each)

**Trigger-based loading:**
- User asks course question → Load `.claude/guides/task-manager-core.md`
- User ends session → Load `.claude/guides/session-logger-core.md`
- Need detailed workflow → Reference `.claude/commands/task-manager/WORKFLOWS.md`

**See**: `.claude/README.md` for complete folder structure guide.

## Project Overview

This is a monorepo project for learning UI component modularization and design systems. It contains two packages demonstrating the migration from a legacy design system (`before`) to a modern design system (`after`) using TailwindCSS, CVA (Class Variance Authority), shadcn/ui, and Storybook.

**Purpose**: Understanding the problems with legacy systems and learning modern design system practices including:
- The concept of Atomic Design vs. practical folder structure
- Migration from CSS to TailwindCSS + CVA
- Component API consistency
- Accessibility and type safety

## Communication Guidelines

### Language Preference
- **항상 한글로 답변해주세요**: All responses should be in Korean unless specifically requested otherwise.

### MCP (Model Context Protocol) Usage
- **MCP를 적극 활용하세요**: When MCP tools can provide more accurate, up-to-date, or relevant information, they MUST be used.
- Examples of when to use MCP:
  - Looking up library documentation (Context7)
  - Accessing IDE diagnostics
  - Executing code in Jupyter notebooks
  - Web automation with Playwright

### Interactive Clarification
- **필요한 정보를 요청하세요**: If additional information would help provide a better answer, proactively ask the user for clarification.
- Don't make assumptions when requirements are unclear
- Use the AskUserQuestion tool when facing ambiguous implementation choices

### Documentation Reference
- **`.claude/` 폴더를 참고하세요**: When looking for reference documentation or creating project-specific documentation:
  - Check `.claude/doc/` directory first
  - Current documentation includes:
    - `chapter_goal.md`: Project objectives, requirements, and implementation guidelines
  - This is the primary source for project context and guidelines

### Learning Session Continuity

- **이전 세션 로그를 자동으로 참고하세요**: When a user starts a new learning session:

  1. Check `.claude/tasks/learning-sessions/` for the most recent session log
  2. Read the last session file (e.g., `2025-11-24-session-1.md`)
  3. Review the "다음 세션 계획" section at the end
  4. Start the new session by continuing from where the user left off
  5. Reference completed tasks and learned concepts to provide context-aware coaching

- **Purpose**: Maintain learning continuity across multiple sessions and avoid asking users to repeat context

## Task Manager (Coaching Mode)

**Purpose:** Coach learners to solve Chapter3-1 independently (no direct implementation).

**Auto-trigger:** Questions ("어떻게", "왜", "다음"), stuck, lost, validation requests

**Principles:**
- ⛔ No direct code/answers
- ✅ Socratic questions, hints, checklists, progressive guidance (Level 1-4)

**Core Guide:** `.claude/guides/task-manager-core.md`

**Detailed Resources:**
- Full guide: `.claude/commands/task-manager/TASK_MANAGER.md`
- Workflows: `.claude/commands/task-manager/WORKFLOWS.md`
- Task list: `.claude/tasks/breakdown.md`

## Learning Session Logger

**Purpose:** Auto-record learning journey in Notion markdown for PR/retro writing.

**Auto-trigger:** "오늘은 여기까지", "학습 마무리", "세션 종료"

**Collects:** Questions/answers, code changes (git log), task progress, timestamps

**Output:** `.claude/tasks/learning-sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-session-N.md`

**Includes:** Session info, Q&A, concepts, code snippets, problems solved, commits table, **PR/retro notes**

**Security:** Auto-filters API keys, tokens, passwords

### Key Architectural Concepts

**Legacy System Issues (before package)**:
1. **Inconsistent Component APIs**: Each component uses different prop names (`width` vs `size`, `helpText` vs `help` vs `description`)
2. **Mixed Styling Approaches**: Inline styles, CSS Modules, and hardcoded color values coexist
3. **UI Components with Business Logic**: Components like `Button.tsx` contain domain-specific logic (checking user roles, post status)
4. **Poor Type Safety**: Loose type definitions, manual validation
5. **Accessibility Issues**: Incomplete ARIA labels, limited keyboard navigation

**Modern System Goals (after package)**:
1. **Consistent APIs**: Unified prop naming conventions
2. **TailwindCSS + CVA**: Utility-first styling with variant patterns
3. **Separation of Concerns**: UI components free from business logic
4. **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript with VariantProps
5. **Accessibility**: Full ARIA support via Radix UI primitives

### Data Layer

Both packages use **localStorage-based services** for user and post management:
- `userService`: CRUD operations for User entities
- `postService`: CRUD operations for Post entities + status actions (publish, archive, restore)

**User Interface**:
- `id`, `username`, `email`, `role` (admin/moderator/user), `status` (active/inactive/suspended)

**Post Interface**:
- `id`, `title`, `content`, `author`, `category`, `status` (draft/published/archived), `views`

Services include validation (e.g., duplicate username check, minimum title length).

### Testing

- **Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library
- **Setup**: `src/test/setup.ts` configures jsdom environment
- **Tests**: Located in `__tests__/` directories (e.g., `ManagementPage.test.tsx`)
- **Commands**: Use `pnpm test` for watch mode, `pnpm test:ui` for visual interface

## Important Implementation Notes

### When Working on the "after" Package

1. **Use shadcn/ui components**: The goal is to use shadcn/ui CLI to add components:
   ```bash
   cd packages/after
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add input
   # etc.
   ```

2. **Component Structure**: Use flat `components/ui/` folder (like shadcn/ui), not Atomic Design folder hierarchy

3. **Variant Pattern with CVA**: Define variants using class-variance-authority:
   ```typescript
   import { cva, type VariantProps } from "class-variance-authority";

   const buttonVariants = cva(
     "base-classes",
     {
       variants: {
         variant: { primary: "...", secondary: "..." },
         size: { sm: "...", md: "..." }
       },
       defaultVariants: { variant: "primary", size: "md" }
     }
   );
   ```

4. **Separation of Concerns**: Keep UI components pure. Business logic should remain in page components or services.

5. **Storybook Stories**: Create stories for each component to document usage and variants

### Migration Strategy

When migrating from `before` to `after`:
1. Identify the component's **pure UI responsibilities**
2. Extract **business logic** to page level or custom hooks
3. Define **variants** instead of conditional styling
4. Ensure **type safety** with proper TypeScript interfaces
5. Add **accessibility** features using Radix UI primitives
6. Write **Storybook stories** for documentation

### Key Files to Reference

- `packages/before/src/components/atoms/Button.tsx`: Example of UI component with mixed concerns
- `packages/before/src/pages/ManagementPage.tsx`: Main application page showing CRUD operations
- `packages/before/src/services/`: Data layer with localStorage-based persistence

## Technology Stack

- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **Vitest**: Testing framework
- **pnpm**: Package manager (monorepo workspaces)
- **TailwindCSS v4**: Utility-first CSS (target for "after")
- **CVA**: Variant management (target for "after")
- **shadcn/ui**: Component library based on Radix UI (target for "after")
- **Storybook**: Component documentation (target for "after")

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't copy Atomic Design folder structure blindly**: The concept is valuable, but flat structure is more practical
2. **Avoid mixing styling approaches**: In "after" package, use TailwindCSS exclusively
3. **Don't put business logic in UI components**: Keep them pure and reusable
4. **Remember to validate**: Services include validation; ensure UI reflects validation errors properly
5. **Type safety matters**: Use strict TypeScript, avoid `any` types
